## What is AACC?

AACC provides a simple, three-tier system for attributing AI use in creative work across writing, visual art, music, film, and more.

### The Three Tiers:

**1. AI-Modified (AI-Edited)**
- The creator produces the original content
- AI modifies or edits technical aspects, language, or structure for improved clarity, organization, or presentation
- **Attribution:** `By [Creator Name], AI-modified by [AI Name] or AI-edited by [AI Name]`
- **Example:** *"Mercury." By Sarah Chen, AI-Edited by Claude AI (word choice and line break suggestions)*

**2. AI-Assisted**
- The creator and AI collaborate throughout much of the creative process
- Though creator-driven, AI generates substantial elements that the creator selects, significantly modifies, or integrates into their vision
- **Attribution:** `By [Creator Name], AI-assisted by [AI Name]`
- **Example:** *Venus.* Dir. by Chris Taylor, AI-assisted by Runway ML (visual effects and scene generation)

**3. AI-Generated**
- AI creates the primary content from the creator's prompts and direction
- The creator's role is conceptual, curatorial, and editorial
- **Attribution:** `AI-generated by [AI Name], concept by [Creator Name]`
- **Example:** *"Mars." AI-generated by Wondera, concept by Sofia Martinez (Martinez specified genre and mood; AI generated track; Martinez added transitions)*

## Why AACC?

- **Simple:** Three clear tiers, easy to understand
- **Universal:** Works across all creative disciplines
