## What is AACC?

AACC provides a simple, three-tier system for attributing AI use in creative work across writing, visual art, music, film, and more.

### The Three Tiers:

**1. AI-Modified (AI-Edited)**
- The creator produces original content
- AI refines technical aspects, clarity, or presentation
- Attribution: `By [Creator Name], AI-modified by [AI Name]`

**2. AI-Assisted**
- Creator and AI collaborate throughout the process
- AI generates substantial elements that creator modifies/integrates
- Attribution: `By [Creator Name], AI-assisted by [AI Name]`

**3. AI-Generated**
- AI creates primary content from creator's prompts and direction
- Creator's role is conceptual, curatorial, and editorial
- Attribution: `AI-generated by [AI Name], concept by [Creator Name]`

---

## Why AACC?

- **Simple:** Three clear tiers, easy to understand
- **Universal:** Works across all creative disciplines
- **Practical:** Designed for real-world attribution (gallery walls, book covers, credits)
- **Open:** Free to use and adapt under CC BY 4.0
