## What is AACC?

AACC provides a simple, two-tier system for attributing AI use in creative work across writing, visual art, music, film, and more.

### The Two Tiers:

**1. AI-ASSISTED**
- The creator originates and drives the work
- AI contributes through generation, modification, or enhancement at any stage
- The creator makes all major creative decisions and is responsible for the final work
- **Attribution:** `By [Creator Name], AI-assisted by [AI Name]`
- **Examples:** 
  - **Writing:** "Mercury." By Sarah Chen, AI-assisted by Apertus (word choice and line break suggestions)
  - **Film:** *Venus.* Dir. by Chris Taylor, AI-assisted by Runway ML (visual effects and scene generation)
  - **Music:** "Mars." By Luna Rivers, AI-assisted by Wondera (harmonic progressions and arrangement)
  - **Visual Art:** *Jupiter.* By Jamila Banks, AI-assisted by Midjourney (background textures and composition elements)

**2. AI-GENERATED**
- AI creates the primary content from the creator's prompts and direction
- The creator's role is conceptual, curatorial, and editorial
- **Attribution:** `AI-generated by [AI Name], concept by [Creator Name]`
- **Examples:**
  - **Writing:** "Saturn." AI-generated by Apertus, concept by Jordan Lee (Lee provided plot outline and character descriptions; edited final draft)
  - **Film:** *Uranus.* AI-generated by Runway ML, concept by Sam Rivera (Rivera provided scene descriptions and style references; edited sequences)*
  - **Music:** "Neptune." AI-generated by Wondera, concept by Sofia Martinez (Martinez specified genre and mood; AI generated track; Martinez added transitions)
  - **Visual Art:** *Pluto Demoted.* AI-generated by Midjourney, concept by Kai Thompson (Thompson crafted prompts through 50+ iterations; selected and refined final image)

## Why AACC?

- **Simple:** Two clear tiers, easy to understand and apply
- **Universal:** Works across all creative disciplines
- **Practical:** Designed for real-world attribution (gallery walls, book covers, credits)
- **Flexible:** Optional detail allows creators to specify exactly how AI was used
- **Open:** Free to use and adapt under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

## How to Use

1. Review the two tiers
2. Ask yourself: **Did I originate this work, or did AI?**
   - If you created first and AI helped → **AI-Assisted**
   - If AI created first from your direction → **AI-Generated**
3. Use the attribution format for your tier
4. Optionally add details in parentheses about what the AI did
5. See [detailed examples](https://davemalone.net/aacc/examples) for your discipline

## Use Examples by Tier

**Tier 1 (AI-Assisted):**
- Writer edits with AI tools
- Filmmaker grades color with AI
- Musician masters audio with AI
- Visual artist paints over AI-generated backgrounds
- Writer substantially revises AI-drafted passages
- Photographer composites AI-generated elements

**Tier 2 (AI-Generated):**
- AI creates full image from text prompt
- AI composes song from style parameters
- AI generates video from scene descriptions
- AI writes story from plot outline

## Adding Optional Detail

You can add specificity about AI's role in parentheses:

**Basic:** `By Sarah Chen, AI-assisted by Apertus`

**Detailed:** `By Sarah Chen, AI-assisted by Apertus (word choice and line break suggestions)`

This helps audiences understand exactly how AI contributed while keeping the base attribution simple.
